# rdwplus 0.1.0

This package version is the first to be released on CRAN. Prior to this it was in development on GitHub as version 0.0.0.9000.

# rdwplus 0.1.0.9000

This package version is a work-in-progress for some patches to the current package. 

The main goals of this package version are:

1. To update the package for GRASS 7.8. The package was originally built for GRASS 7.6, and the tutorial in the current REAMDE reflects this.
2. To address some issues we have encountered when applying rdwplus to larger data sets.
3. To check/correct some geoprocessing workflows for deriving watersheds, flow path lengths, etc.
