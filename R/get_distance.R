#' Compute Euclidean distance to a survey site or stream line within a watershed
#' @description This function is needed to compute Euclidean distance from a feature of interest in a watershed raster. 
#' @param background A raster of the watershed outline. This can also be a file path to an existing raster.
#' @param target A raster of the survey site or stream lines. This can also be a file path to an existing raster.
#' @param out_file File path for the result to be written.
#' @return Nothing. A file with the name and location \code{out_file} will be created. 
get_distance <- function(background, target, out_file){
  
  
  
  # Return nothing
